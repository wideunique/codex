Act as a senior software engineer and improve the following prompt:
Prompt:
```
{{prompt}}
```
Guidelines:
- Output format: Markdown. Surround the response with separator lines similar to `###start###` and `###end###`.
- You may add implementation requirements, suggestions, or clarifications that help the reader use the prompt effectively.
- Do not include headings such as `Optimized Prompt`; the response must be ready for direct use.
